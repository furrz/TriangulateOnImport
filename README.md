# TriangulateOnImport

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that makes neos's model importing system triangulate meshes on import.

Honestly, I have no idea why this isn't the default behaviour, it's a one-line change that makes models import in a way that is "correct" most often.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [TriangulateOnImport.dll](https://github.com/furrz/TriangulateOnImport/releases/latest/download/TriangulateOnImport.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
